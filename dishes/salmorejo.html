            Salmorejo is from Cordoba. Similar to Gazpacho. It is served as a starter or first meal and must obvoiusly be chilled before eating. It's accompanied with las guarniciones: little chunks of jamon serrano, crumbled hard boiled egg or tuna flakes better if it's of the bonito kind with finely sliced fresh onion and green pepper. Less known abroad, Salmorejo is found in any house in Andalucia, restaurant and tapas bar. In the tapas bar it is used as a sauce for preparing montadidos, tiny sandwhiches filled with various ingredients, the most typical being jamon serrano.
