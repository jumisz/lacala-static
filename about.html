<h2>Masterchef</h2>

<!--Insert photos of the book, recipes and synopsis. -->

<p>I applied in 2009 and after various telephone interviews and visits to the primrose
Hill studio in London with samples of my food, I got in!! It was great fun, although
the filming itself was pretty stressful as I was pregnant. Right place wrong time. I
met some good and not so good cooks and am certain of two things: one that I love
cooking and two that I do not want a career on TV.</p>

<h2>Markets and Festivals</h2>

<p>When I can fit it in I have a stall on the Winchester Market (<a href="http://

www.visitwinchester.co.uk/site/whats-on/markets</a>) I started in September 2011 just
for fun. It has been great fun and has also led to some interesting business for La
Cala Catering.</p>

<p>I have a Microwave, a griddle a fryer and a slow cooker so I can prepare lovely
lunches fro people on the go or provide a delicatessen take-away service for those
having dinner parties and wanting to offer something different to their guests. I also
have regular customers to whom I deliver fortnightly meals to stock up their freezers.</p>
